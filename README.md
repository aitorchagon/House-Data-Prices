# House-Data-Prices

The main objective of this project is create a step-by-step pipeline to preprocess
and analyze the House Prices datasetso we can get as much information as we can 
and learn as much as possible in the process.

The idea is to build a regression model, via the different alternatives
that exist in the literature, to predict the prices of houses
within Ames city, Iowa, United States.
